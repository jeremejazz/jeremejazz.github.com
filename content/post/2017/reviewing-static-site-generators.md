Today there are easier ways in building a website. And one of them has been the use of static site generators
<!--more-->

Back then the internet was young people back then had to write HTML scripts for their websites. They often had to copy/paste some codes to replicate them on different pages for elements such as menus or footers. This had been a very tedious task especially for those working with multiple pages. Then some would have to use the old `<frame>` tag.  

Then came dynamic websites such as Perl CGI and PHP, that made building websites easier since users are now able to write scripts that can display pages. From that, content management systems were made. Now users can easily edit the website directly from the output of the scripts itself. 

One problem though, it has become a bit overkill. It is not cheap to set up a dynamic website. 
<!-- draft points to consider -->
- Slow rendering (from database) though there are workarounds such as Caching and compression that renders a dynamic website to static html pages on the fly
- Cost of hosting
- complexity

This field offered new opportunities in the industry apart from cryptocurrencies.
Since the conference involved choosing your "breakout session", I've decided to attend the topics that involved Ethereum, another cryptocurrency that was inspired from Bitcoin that had it's improvements especially in development. They provided an overview with the programming languages and frameworks used to develop your own digital currencies with a demo for a real world application as well. There was also a separate discussion about Hyperledger, a parallel project by the Linux Foundation. Representatives of organizations such as  Hyperledger Project, Amihan Global, Magpie, and ZendCreative provided some insights on the topic.

## DevOps

The field that leverages today's modern systems administrator. An overview of Devops tools were discussed such as Docker and Kuberbetes. There was also a discussion about microservices architecture and continuous deployment of a sample PHP app and how Kubernetes "magically" handles scaling and the other problems administrators had in the past. For the past Devcon summit events they have already been discussing about this. Though DevOps has already become matured with it's new tools throughout the years. The discussion for DevOps were brought up by representatives of CloudNative Foundation, Pantheon, and Samsung.

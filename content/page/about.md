I'm Jereme Causing, a Software Developer from Metro Manila, Philippines. Mostly I do full-stack web development. I love to share what I know through blogging, participating in communities, and training. I've been working on the web for around 7 years and have experienced a lot of endeavors. 

Outside coding, I enjoy reading books, playing with a band, window shopping, or going out to the movies. I am into green energy and nature trips.

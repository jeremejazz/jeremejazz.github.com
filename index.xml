One of the main reasons of using Wordpress and other content management is to make editing dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For those who don’t know what distributed version control is, it is an automated way of storing changes on your code while collaborating with other programmers under that shared project. Think of it as creating backup copies of your project on your drive (and probably adding dates on your compressed folders) and merging your latest code with your teammate.</description>
